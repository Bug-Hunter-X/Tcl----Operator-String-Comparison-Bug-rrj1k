This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming related to the use of the '==' operator for numerical comparison.  The '==' operator in Tcl performs string comparison rather than numerical comparison. This example shows how comparing numerically equivalent strings can produce unexpected results. The solution offers a workaround to perform accurate numerical comparison.
